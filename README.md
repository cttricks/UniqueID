# UniqueID
This is a very simple java code that i have written to generate Unique ID or say random alphanumeric string. Also note that apart from logic i have written this code to be compiled as an mit app inventor extension. Anyone who is here and viewing this code can use this to lean and compile his/her own extension for free. 

Enjoy!!
